# Arduino based TV Remote

This Device switches off an LG TV based on the status of the LED on an apple TV. If the LED is turned off for longer than 20 Seconds - indicating that the apple tv is turned off, the Arduino will trigger an IR signal to the LG TV to turn it off as well.


## Hardware

The Hardware is based off **Arduino** and is therefore open source. The plans will be available on this page. The only sensor required is a small light sensor that is stuck onto the front of the apple TV.

## Software

Software is developed by Andrin Walla.
