# The Postman

The Postman is a tiny device you can put in your mailbox. It can tell you if you have mail and push a message to your phone.


## Hardware

The Hardware is based off **Arduino** and is therefore open source. The plans will be available on this page. The main Sensor is comprised of a light sensor and an LED. They are positioned in the mailbox in such a way that if a letter is inside, the light sensor can no longer see the LED and as a consequence outputs a lower value.

## Software

Software is developed by Andrin Walla.
